<div class="main-text narrative" markdown="1">
He mentions that he’s planning on getting more in shape. He and his roommate are going to practice boxing, he asks me to order him a jump rope. It’s a little odd, but it’s a good thing to be active. When I ask him why he’s doing this, I expect an easy answer. But it's not easy. Reminders are scattered everywhere.

### definitions

You can damage your pattern with one of the following strategies.

* If some part of your body starts to tire of your pattern, you can **deaden** that part of you or it. Choose one element or moment to remove, or stop moving some part of your body. Listen to your body intensely until you've forgotten about it.
* If you start to feel bored of your pattern, you can **defer** your responsibility to the piece for awhile. Play an entirely new pattern based off of one or more of the melodic fragments listed below; once created, it behaves like any other pattern. Listen to your new idea until you've forgotten it wasn't old.
* If, while playing, you **remember** where you are and what you're doing, freeze completely; the only thing that should move is your eyes. Hold your breath. Focus on your neighbor, on the floor, anything but your instrument. Listen to what you hear until you've forgotten.

If you were using one of the above strategies but have managed to **forget** why you were doing it, return to your original pattern. Or at least what you think it might have been, what it should have been.

When you remember where you are and what you’re doing,

suddenly, body frozen, bow still stuck on whatever string you were just playing.

Focus on your neighbor, on the floor, anything but your instrument. Listen to what you hear around you until you’ve forgotten.

### progression

<span class="time">3'00"</span>
Each player should keep a close watch on their mind and body, and should start applying the above **strategies** when appropriate. Make the frequency and duration of these interruptions something that you feel suits your role, though they should become more frequent as this section continues.

Add the strategies in one at a time - only use **deaden** at first, but later include **defer**, and finally **remember**.

The pitch range of your ritual should expand to the full range of your instrument by the end of this section.

		<p class="start">less interruption<br />lower pitch<br /><em>mf</em></p>
		<p>more interruption<br />full range<br /><em>ff</em></p>
	</div>
</div>

<span class="time">4'45"</span>
The Driver should start playing the first pitch of the pitch set of the next section. *Together* begins when the rest of the ensemble convenes on one pitch. Players should join this unison pitch one at a time.

<!-- 
- add "each individual should do this intermittently" earlier
- get rid of the "melodic fragments" part
- give some actual melodic fragments to choose from!
- isn't clear that they should be more + more frequent
- continue until it gets too high + quiet and disappears -->
