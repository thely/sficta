## Alone, 2'

### definitions

The ensemble drops out abruptly, leaving just the Driver as a **solo**, continuing to repeat the pitch set as before, but now with no limitations on note length. This solo should remain barely audible and bitterly alone.

The other members will eventually add a **ritual** that has no sound whatsoever. This particular pattern should comprise only gestures that would make sense onstage while silent: shuffling feet, looking askance, leaning forward, turning pages, gripping or regripping the bow, etc. It should never be overly obvious, and every non-Driver should attempt to sync up with the player who starts the pattern. These will last about ten repeats before ending, and should be followed by at least 10" of complete stillness from its participants before a ritual is attempted again.

Any member can initiate this particular ritual, apart from the Driver. <span class="weep">If this feels unnatural, you are not wrong.</span>

### progression

<span class="time">8'30"</span>
The ensemble abruptly drops out of the **unison**, allowing the Driver turn its quiet part into the **solo**. The solo should stay at the same dynamic throughout, but stay incredibly tense.

<span class="time">9'00"</span>
The rest of the ensemble starts incorporating inaudible collective **rituals**, about 10 repeats long, with 10" pauses before trying again.
