## 1. Unison

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">
Every player plays the same pitch, while being as different from each other in every way as they possibly can. This can and should include dynamics, duration, timbre, posture, etc. Change your pitch when you hear pitch change.

(((some kind of graphic goes here about the progression of things: Driver starts, slowly, people enter in one at a time, some expression of the pitch set, "slowly become your role")))
