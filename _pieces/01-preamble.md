## Preamble

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">
In Tarot, the four suits of the Minor Arcana represent four different aspects of daily life. Wands represent creativity, cups represent emotions and spirituality, pentacles represent wealth, and swords represent intellect and justice. The Ace of each suit is that suit’s concept at its most pure, while the Ten of each suit takes the idea of the Ace to its logical conclusion.

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">
The Ace of Swords shows a single hand bursting forth from the clouds, holding a single sword; it indicates a boon of mental clarity, truth, justice, and a fighting spirit. *The Ten of Swords* shows a prone man, stabbed through the back with all ten swords, facing away from the viewer, but towards a distant sunrise. It indicates total and utter defeat, a painful but inevitable ending, yet the sunrise implies new hope after the fall.

*The Ten of Swords* starts with each performer picking a role that represents some strategy for withstanding loss or trial. Your role will influence when/how/what you play, and how you move. Other roles not listed are also possible; only _Driver_ is required.

In some sections, no specific instructions will be given for specific parts–it is up to each performer to determine what makes the most sense for his/her role. In other sections, per-role instructions are provided, but do not necessarily need to be obeyed (except for the _Driver_) if you find something better.

* Driver: You are the leader. You are responsible and dependable, and must always push onwards, for others are depending on you. They must not see you crack. 
* Dissident: The world should be different, and you know it. You can feel it, endlessly, prickling beneath your skin. You wish everyone knew it. There must be a way.
* Dreamer: The future will come eventually, and you will be there for it. Perhaps there is something you can do, perhaps not. Only the present exists.
* Disciple: You exist for another. Their actions are more perfect than yours. Be more like them, or at least who you think they need you to be.

### definitions

Each section has a piece of narrative, some definitions, and how that section should progress. A collapsed version with progressions (i.e., a normal score) can be found here.

Words that are **highlighted** are common vocabulary for the piece, and are likely to show up more than once.

<span class="time">0'12"</span>
Time markers are there to establish approximate durations of sections, but these times are not strict. The piece should not go beyond 10', but time markers inside of that are flexible.

<!--
- give the driver more of a character
- maybe make the driver a tag on one of the roles? or describe them better
- Lead pitch changes based off the pitch set given. Give at least 10s between changes.

Dissident: Fluctuate your shared pitch enough to cause beating, when possible. Intersperse this with mostly-correct pitch.
* Dreamer: Take your time arriving to new pitches. No one needs to change pitch immediately, but you can be _especially_ slow.
