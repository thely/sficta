## 0. Preamble

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">
*If we could have it together* starts with each player picking a role. Your role will influence when/how/what you play, and how you move. In most sections, no specific instructions will be given for specific partsâ€“it is up to each performer to determine what makes the most sense for his/her role. Take care not to overexaggerate.

Others roles not listed are also possible; only _Driver_ is required.
</div>

<div class="roles-block" markdown="1">
* Driver: Lead pitch changes based off the pitch set given. Give at least 10s between changes.
* Dissident: Fluctuate your shared pitch enough to cause beating, when possible. Intersperse this with mostly-correct pitch.
* Dreamer: Take your time arriving to new pitches. No one needs to change pitch immediately, but you can be _especially_ slow.
* Disciple: You exist for another. Their actions are more perfect than yours. Be more like them.
