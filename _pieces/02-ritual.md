<!-- My day-to-day has become much stranger. He’s a pessimist because he has to be, but I live in both his best and worst futures. Some days I’m hopeful, because he’s grown so much that I have to believe he’ll make it through. Other days I see through his eyes–how dark it all seems. Once a week I have to spend the day forgetting what’s coming. We call most evenings. -->

## Rituals, 3'

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">

### definitions

In this work, a **ritual** is an obsessively repeated pattern. These patterns are short gestures or phrases, about 5" to 10" (just long enough to feel like one complete thought), where every change to timbre, pitch, dynamics, and body movement are repeated as identically as you can manage without injury.

* It's appropriate for a pattern to stop abruptly, as if cut short. Some of your patterns may feel like poorly-looped GIFs, as in the examples below.
* Your pattern does not necessarily need to include pitch.

The pattern you choose should reflect your role somehow, and does not need to be the same from performance to performance. The examples below are not precise to your instrument, and are intended to help you consider physicality in addition to pitch.

	<h3>example 1</h3>
	<p>stiff shoulder leads movement diagonally up and left; brow furrows before ascent; peak of the gesture occurs with a downbow + tremolo</p>

	<h3>example 2</h3>
	<p>instrument leans forward as head turns away (possibly about to sneeze?), both shoulders raise and follow head, bow drifts diagonally between bridge and fingerboard</p>

Over time, you will need to **perfect** these rituals, to change some aspect of them through iterative improvements. In the quest for absolutes, you can either:

* (a) emphasize one element of a single moment over successive repeats, or
* (b) keep adding extra steps to the beginning or end of your pattern.

(a) This added emphasis is made to one single moment of your pattern. Some examples:

* your second note gets louder every time
* the degree to which you lean left after your first three pitches becomes more exaggerated every repeat
* the silence after your fifth note becomes longer every repeat
* a bow stroke that previously did not touch any string gets closer and closer, eventually producing pitch

The Platonic ideal of the moment or aspect you're attempting to perfect is up to you. Perhaps the B you played was meant to be an A; perhaps a loud stomp should have been a small shuffle. A moment's ideal form is also subject to change; once the B becomes an A, only then do you realize it ought to be a Bb.

(b) Only one new thing should be added every repeat. You can choose an approximate number of extra steps to add to make this pattern truly "perfect," and switch back to (a) once you've repeated enough times to add that amount in. Or perhaps there is no total that ever feels satisfactory.

Regardless of which form of perfect you choose, you might encounter some form of failure, through forgetting the order of events or running out of room to add more emphasis. <span class="weep">It is right to feel frustrated when you make this mistake.</span>

### progression

<span class="time">0'00"</span>
Two players start separate but simultaneous **rituals**. Pitch should be in the low register for your instrument. While these players should start together, there is no reason for their patterns to be the same length. Patterns can fluctuate in and out of phase, or repeat perfectly in sync; it's up to the pair.

<span class="time">0'45"</span>
Once one member of the pair <span>hears some amount of change</span> in their partner's pattern, they should start to **perfect** their own.

<span class="time">1'30"</span>
When the members of the second pair <span>start to get nervous about elapsed time</span>, they should wait ten more seconds before starting in the same fashion as the first pair. Start together, repeat together if desired, wait for change before perfecting.

<span class="time">2'00"</span>
The two pairs respond to each other through perfecting. Maintain your rituals, but use either method of perfecting to form a dialogue.

<!-- 
- something other than 5" for the silence: think about actual times!!!
- 2" rituals. "A ritual is a short gesture, phrase, in which every change etc etc." Define the thing. "Examples of rituals below": Make it clear what a ritual is!
- "as you repeat, choose one aspect to perfect as you repeat, one thing that gets more clear, drastic, destructive, or other." Make one thing more exponential. Choose one aspect to focus on, one "moment" in time, such as, "more clear" is confusing, "more noticeable."
- Fuss around with this whole block a little more!
- something between looking natural and looking mechanical: the gestures you produce should be related to the sound you're making

is it a musical unfolding, how does that change the energy of the musicians?

- physical producing the musical, rather than the other way around
- if we're collectively obsessive, how is that different than being obsessive alone? tribalism?
- obsession: there's a depth we can achieve here, which can be useful, or can be very bad. what are the pros/cons of obsessing, what can this touch on? what are the complexities of that? you hit depth, but also go crazy? blindedness of being so inside of something that you can't see outside of it.
- what someone else sees as beautiful?

rituals: do one thing a lot. pick a wide pitch range?

breaking: stop everything, occasionally, either for complete silence or to play one of the melodic fragments

numbing: choose one thing to remove from your pattern, or stop moving some parts of your body
forgetting: as you were
remembering: stop what you're doing
deferring: play one of the melodic fragments

together: move toward unison. sporadic shorter rituals that die out after X repeats
