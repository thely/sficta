<div class="main-text narrative" markdown="1">
My day-to-day has become much stranger. He’s a pessimist because he has to be, but I live in both his best and worst futures. Some days I’m hopeful, because he’s grown so much that I have to believe he’ll make it through. Other days I see through his eyes–how dark it all seems. Once a week I have to spend the day forgetting what’s coming. We call most evenings.

## Rituals

<div class="main-text" markdown="1">

### definitions

In this work, a **ritual** is an obsessively repeated pattern. These patterns are short gestures or phrases, about 5" to 10" (just long enough to feel like one complete thought), where every change to timbre, pitch, dynamics, and body movement are repeated as identically as you can manage without injury.

* It's appropriate for a pattern to stop abruptly, as if cut short.
* Your pattern does not necessarily need to include pitch.

The pattern you choose should reflect your role somehow, and does not need to be the same from performance to performance. The examples below are not precise to your instrument.

Over time, you will need to **perfect** these rituals. You can either (a) perfect your pattern by emphasizing one element of it over successive repeats, or (b) keep adding extra steps to the beginning or end of your pattern. Adding emphasis can mean many things, such as: 

* one note gets louder every time
* an extraneous physical movement becomes more obvious
* you leave more and more space after a certain note
* a gesture that previously did not produce pitch now produces pitch

Regardless of which form of perfect you choose, you might encounter some form of failure, through forgetting the order of events or running out of room to add more emphasis. <span class="weep">It is right to feel frustrated when you make this mistake.</span>

### progression

<span class="time">0'00"</span>
Two players start separate but simultaneous **rituals**. Pitch should be in the low register for your instrument. While these players should start together, there is no reason for their patterns to be the same length. Patterns can fluctuate in and out of phase, or repeat perfectly in sync; it's up to the pair.

<span class="time">0'45"</span>
Once one member of the pair <span>hears some amount of change</span> in their partner's pattern, they should start to **perfect** their own.

<span class="time">1'30"</span>
When the members of the second pair <span>start to get nervous about elapsed time</span>, they should start in the same fashion as the first: start together, repeat together if desired, wait for change before changing.

<span class="time">2'00"</span>
The two pairs interact in small ways, even if just in response to each other.

<!-- 
- something other than 5" for the silence: think about actual times!!!
- 2" rituals. "A ritual is a short gesture, phrase, in which every change etc etc." Define the thing. "Examples of rituals below": Make it clear what a ritual is!
- "as you repeat, choose one aspect to perfect as you repeat, one thing that gets more clear, drastic, destructive, or other." Make one thing more exponential. Choose one aspect to focus on, one "moment" in time, such as, "more clear" is confusing, "more noticeable."
- Fuss around with this whole block a little more!
- something between looking natural and looking mechanical: the gestures you produce should be related to the sound you're making

is it a musical unfolding, how does that change the energy of the musicians?

- physical producing the musical, rather than the other way around
- if we're collectively obsessive, how is that different than being obsessive alone? tribalism?
- obsession: there's a depth we can achieve here, which can be useful, or can be very bad. what are the pros/cons of obsessing, what can this touch on? what are the complexities of that? you hit depth, but also go crazy? blindedness of being so inside of something that you can't see outside of it.
- what someone else sees as beautiful?

rituals: do one thing a lot. pick a wide pitch range?

breaking: stop everything, occasionally, either for complete silence or to play one of the melodic fragments

numbing: choose one thing to remove from your pattern, or stop moving some parts of your body
forgetting: as you were
remembering: stop what you're doing
deferring: play one of the melodic fragments

together: move toward unison. sporadic shorter rituals that die out after X repeats
