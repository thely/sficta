It's impossible to talk about, or at least impossible to talk about without being judged. Everyone has opinions, but none of them have context, and I have no desire to exhaust myself with people who can't understand my decision. So it stays with me, and me alone.

## Resolve, 1'30"

### definitions

As this piece was written in the middle of the events it explores, it would be foolhardy or presumptuous to attempt to end it with any specific emotional tone. A negative result could lead to some unknown long-term success; a positive result could lead to long-term ennui. While the Driver should maintain the solo high in their range and very quiet, their internal experience is not one that should be prescribed.

Instead, the internal state of the Driver is determined by a Tarot **reading**, either with a single card or a three-card spread (past, present, future). Drawing and interpreting a single card is much faster, but Tarot works much better when multiple cards can give context to one another. (Many prefer the ten-card Celtic Cross, but the three-card spread is the best halfway point.)

Interpret the card or spread as it makes sense to you, or as it might contribute to the piece's end. While its visual may contribute to your decisions, dig into the card's meaning as much as you can for possible directions to go. Look at other Tarot card interpretation sites, get a feel for what different people find in these cards. Most cards have multiple possible meanings, and usually one or two will strike you.

Include as much of the earlier vocabulary in the piece as you like–invoke **rituals**, **perfect** them, break them up by **remember**ing.

Because Tarot requires time to interpret, randomly picking a card shortly before performance isn’t recommended. There is no need to draw a new ending card before every performance of the piece (unless desired), as subsequent performances may help enrich your interpretation of the original card. It’s fully acceptable to never change the ending card once chosen; this is up to you.

It’s also worth noting that Tarot is best approached not as a divination tool, but as one of reflection. How you interpret this card may be “ending” the piece, but there’s no need to assume that this is intended as a predicted “ending” of the situation. It may not even relate to my experience at all–you may find it relates to your interpretation of the events described, your feelings on what the performance feels like to you, or instead to events happening in your own life.

You can use your own cards, or use the card picker at the bottom of this page. _You should never show these cards to anyone else, nor should you tell them what your interpretation was, no matter what. It will not help. Some things must be secrets._

### progression

<span class="time">10'30"</span>
The Driver continues, now including the internal interpretation of the Tarot reading in their performance, however it manifests. The rest of the ensemble stops moving apart from small, barely noticeable movements.

<span class="time">11'00"</span>
The Driver continues; the ensemble stops moving completely, in whatever pose they find themselves. They should stare at the Driver and not stop until after the piece finishes, after they bow.

<span class="time">12'00"</span>
The Driver ends the piece as suits their reading (12' is best, but this can vary), gently or abruptly, with silence or with sound. The ensemble should be alert enough such that when the Driver moves to bow, they move immediately as well.

Don't worry if the applause is slow to notice you standing or bowing. Bow anyways; ignore them. Continue on as you always have.
