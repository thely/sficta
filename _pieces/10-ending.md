As this piece was written in the middle of the events it describes, it would be foolhardy and presumptuous to attempt to give it a fixed ending, or to ascribe positive or negative qualities to the unknown future. A negative result could lead to some unknown long-term success; a positive result could lead to long-term ennui. Instead, the ending of a performance of this piece is determined by the ensemble’s interpretation of a randomly-chosen Tarot card or Tarot spread. (Drawing and interpreting a single card is much faster, but Tarot works much better when multiple cards can give context to one another. The three-card spread is the best halfway point.)

Interpret the card or spread as it makes sense to you, or as it might contribute to the piece's end. While its visual may contribute to your decisions, dig into the card's meaning as much as you can for possible directions to go. Take the vocabulary of the piece and your role into account when picking material, but the direction, tone, and timbral choices are up to you.

Because Tarot requires time to interpret, randomly picking a card shortly before performance isn’t recommended. While the Driver is the one who should draw the card(s), all members of the ensemble can weigh in on its interpretation. There is no need to draw a new ending card before every performance of the piece (unless desired), as subsequent performances may help enrich your interpretation of the original card. It’s fully acceptable to never change the ending card once chosen; this is up to you.

It’s also worth noting that Tarot is best approached not as a divination tool, but as one of reflection. How you interpret this card may be “ending” the piece, but there’s no need to assume that this is intended as a predicted “ending” of the situation. It may not even relate to my experience at all–you may find it relates to your interpretation of the events described, your feelings on what the performance feels like to you, or instead to events happening in your own life.

Pick a card.
