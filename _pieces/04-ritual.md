Silence, 5", then:

Two players start separate but complimentary repeated \~2" rituals, in which every change to timbre, pitch, and body movement are repeated. Stay in the pitch set of the madrigal (establish this set). Examples:

You should start together, but there is no reason for your rituals to be the same length. It's completely appropriate for your rituals to fluctuate in being in and out of phase with each other. After enough repeats, the other two should start in the same fashion, though the groups don't need to interact.

Choose one thing to "perfect" as you repeat––one thing that gets more clear, or more drastic, or more destructive, etc. Or keep adding extra steps on to your ritual.
